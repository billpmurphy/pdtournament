-------------- Bots, rounds, and matches --------------

-- A bot is a function that takes another bot and the history of the previous
-- rounds as input, and returns a Choice inside the BotEnvironment monad, which
-- is a subset of the IO monad that allows bots to generate random numbers and
-- simulate other bots with or without a timeout function. However, to prevent
-- bots from "breaking out of the box," any other forms of IO will not work
-- inside this monad.

-------------- Tournament structure --------------

-- A tournament is a series of round-robin elimination rounds. At the end of
-- each round-robin round, the bots with scores lower than the median score are
-- removed from the tournament pool. This process is repeated until only one
-- bot remains, or until there is a tie between all the remaining bots.

-- You can use these functions to run demo tournaments to battle-test your bot.
-- Check out the Bots.hs file for an example tournament.
